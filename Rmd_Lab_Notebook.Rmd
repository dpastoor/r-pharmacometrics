Rmd Lab Notebook
========================================================

This documentation will eventually grow to a more complete resource of some "better" practices and examples for how to design and maintain an Rmd lab notebook.

##Good Practices
* Compile documents in a clean R session `rm(list = ls())`
* attach `sessionInfo()` at the bottom of every document!
* If you have multiple files or additional complexities using a Makefile may be easier long term
* use chunk labels if possible
* 
## Some 'gotchas' for knitting

* when knitted, each chunk is evaluated based on a working directory of the current file location of the Rmd document. 
        * This directory is reset after each chunk! So no setting in a higher level chunk and forgetting

## Extracting R Code
To *tangle* (extract program code), the function `purl()` will compile all R-code to a single .R file.

```
library(knitr)
purl("your-file.Rmd")
# results in your-file.R
```

## Chunk Labels
Think of chunk labels as unique id's in a document. While they are used mainly for geration of external files, naming allows you to reference them elsewhere in your document. Automatically generated figures are also based on chunk-label names.

## Global Options
global options can be modified at any point in your document and will affect all chunks below.

The syntax is `opts_chunk$set(<options-you-want,...>)`

## Digits of Output

* Control with `options(scipen = <#>, digits = <#>)`
        * `scipen` - controls when reported as scientific notation
        * digits = # digits to report

## Showing/Hiding Output Options
* `echo`
* `results`
    * `asis`
    * `hide`
* `warning/error/message`
* `split`
* `include`

## Figures
* Alignment - `fig.align = default=center/left/right`
* Path - `fig.path`

## Caching
* `cache = TRUE`

Do have some nice granular control options however
* update if version changes `version = R.version.string` 
* check to see if input file changes `<file>_name=file.info('<file>.csv')$mtime` and re-read data if newer
* check if other chunk updates `dependson='<chunk-name>'`
        * can also take integer chunk names `dependson = -1` would set dependency for chunk above

## Cross-Referencing

```
```{r my-theme, eval=FALSE}
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 18),
)
```
```

Then in later chunk
```{r, eval = FALSE}
qplot(conc, Time, data = Theoph, color = Subject) + <<my-theme>>
```

## Adding Tables

Knitr has a built in function `kable` that allows for easy creation of tables. 

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(head(Theoph))
```

It is worth checking out the documentation for kable via `?kable`

By default, the output is a markdown table, which makes printing to the console or evaluating the knitted markdown easy. `kable` also allows direct output into latex, html, pandoc, and rst via the `format` argument

One other highly useful argument is `digits`, which passes all values in numeric columns through the `round()` function before printing them out. This prevents analysis results to print all calculated digits.

```{r}
AUC_df <- data.frame(ID = 1:5, AUC = runif(5, 10, 100))
kable(AUC_df)
kable(AUC_df, , digits = 2)
```

QUESTION: can digits be specified for certain columns only?
